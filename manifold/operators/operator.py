# An Operator Node represents a SQL-like operation and
# is used to build an OperatorGraph. Operator forwards
# QUERY Packets received from its parents (Consumers) to its
# children (Producers). Resulting RECORD or ERROR Packets
# are sent back to its parents.
#
# Note:
# - An Operator producer may be either an Operator
# instance or a Socket.
# - An Operator consumer may be either an Operator
# instance or, if this is a From instance, a Gateway.
