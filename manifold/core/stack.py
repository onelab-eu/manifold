    Stack is use to prior some tasks while exploring the 3nf
    graph in order to build the QueryPlan. We first visit the
    tables reachables from the root Table by only traversing
    1..1 arcs. If this is not sufficient to serve the user
    Query, we extend this 3nf-subgraph by adding a part of
    the 3nf graph requiring to traverse 1..N link. This Stack
    allows to order this exploration.

    Stack maintains a set of stacks (one per priority), each
    of these storing a set of ExploreTask. Thus, building
    a QueryPlan only requires one Stack instance.
    - Pushing an ExploreTask in the Stack dispatches it to
    the appropriate nested stack.
    - Poping an ExploreTask extracts the ExploreTask having
    the higher priority.
